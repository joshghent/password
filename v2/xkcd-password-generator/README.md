## Running the tests

This project uses `Jest` for unit tests. Linting is performed by both `ESLint` and `Prettier`.

### Break down into unit and end to end tests

`@TODO` Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Linting and Code Style

#### Linting

- ESLint can be run with `yarn lint`.

- Prettier can be run to maintain coding style. It's highly recommended to use an IDE extension to run [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) on file saves. Otherwise, it can be run from your CLI by running `yarn prettify` -or- `npm prettify`.

Prettier IDE extensions:

- [Vim](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#vim)

- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) (add `"editor.formatOnSave": true` and `"prettier.eslintIntegration": true` to your user settings)

- [Atom](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-atom)

- [Emacs](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/master/editors/emacs)

- [Sublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JsPrettier)

- [JetBrains](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#jetbrains)

#### Code Style

- This project follows the Ducks pattern for naming and convention.

  - [Learn More About Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)

- For version control, we follow a GIT FLOW pattern.

  - [Learn More About GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
  - [Learn More About Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

- For style, we use a CSS-in-JS library called Emotion.

## Deployment

To create an optimized production build...

run `yarn build` -or- `npm build`. This will create a `/build` directory at the root of the project which contains all the compiled code and static assets to be deployed.

- Now you can serve the build folder on a production web server or run it locally to demo or test...

  > `yarn global add serve`

  > `serve -s build`

## Built With

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - The web framework used _(Bootstrapped From Create React App)_
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - State management
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) - CSS-in-JS
