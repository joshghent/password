### Features
* Generate up to 10 english words to use as a password
* Randomize casing of the password
* Include numbers in place of similar letters - e.g. 'a' becomes '4'
* Ability to include special characters - some sites do not allow special chars so beware


I have no claim for the passwords generated to be cryptographically secure.
I do not take responsiblity for any identity theft or any other bad things.

Generated passwords are NOT and will NEVER be stored on our servers.
